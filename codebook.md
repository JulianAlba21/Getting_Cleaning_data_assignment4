Description
-----------

In the following file called organized.csv you can find the tdy data of
data obtained from an experiment in human Activity Recognition using
smarthphones, The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30
volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed
six activities (WALKING, WALKING\_UPSTAIRS, WALKING\_DOWNSTAIRS,
SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on
the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured
3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant
rate of 50Hz.

In the file you will find subject identification, sorted with the
activity, and each one of this will havee the average of diferente
features obtained from the original experiment, this features are listed
belog:
